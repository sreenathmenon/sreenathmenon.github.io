'prefix' => 'Snippet Prefix<p style="font-weight: normal;">Add a prefix to the snippet names. This will make it easier to identify a snippet when used in a template. For example, if your snippet file name is <code>product.html</code>, it will be saved as snippet:product, and used in the template as <code>{snippet:product}</code>.</p>',
'subfolder_suffix' => 'Sub-folder Suffix<p style="font-weight: normal;">If you organize your snippets into sub-folders you can add a suffix to the folder name. For example, if your snippet file name is in <code>/snippets/default_site/global/product.html</code>, it will be saved as <code>snippet:global_product</code>, and used in the template as <code>{snippet:global_product}</code>.</p><p style="font-weight: normal;">This is also used to suffix your MSM Globally Shared Folder name, and used as a separator for your snippet names. You can use dashes in your folder and snippet file names, but save them to the database with underscores.</p>',
'suffix_as_separator' => 'Suffix as separator<p style="font-weight: normal;">If set to yes, all non-alphanumeric characters in your snippet file name will be replaced with the same character defined as your subfolder suffix. For example, if your suffix is set to an underscore and your snippet file name is <code>global.group/some-file.html</code>, then your snippet will be accessible in your template as <code>{snippet:global_some_file}</code> instead of <code>{snippet:global_some-file}</code></p>',

'enable_cleanup' => 'Enabling Cleanup?<p style="font-weight: normal;">This will delete snippets from the database when they are removed from the filesystem. This means if you rename a file based snippet, or delete the file, it will delete it from the database. If you rename a file it will delete the original and create a new database record.</p>',
